# FileX-

This tool helps us to retrieve textual data from thousands of documents. This idea is not restricted to files only; we can also extract textual content from the images uploaded to this tool. The search engine will help us search for data inside files like pdfs, doc files, CSV files, jpeg files, etc. It will help to maintain and organize the files and ease searching within the files. In this way, we do not have to manually search every file for the specific text that we want.
